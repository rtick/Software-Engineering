Final Project for CSE40232

To access site when on campus, go [here](http://fileservice:8080/login.html)
 
To access site when off campus, go [here](http://69.243.168.41:8080/login.html)

When you are going to use the site please email jharkin2@nd.edu and tell me if your are on or off campus so I can start the service up.

If your off campus it might be easier to VPN into the notre dame network and then connect to the on campus site.

New in Version 1.1:

-Redesigned site layout to new design

-Redesigned registration form

-Reserved hostname when service is running on campus (hostname is "fileservice")

Other smaller changes:

-Confirm box for file deletion

-Registration page makes sure password and confirm password fields match, as well as the email field is a valid email.

-Service will detect if connection is coming from on or off campus and automatically adjust, no manual changes needed.
